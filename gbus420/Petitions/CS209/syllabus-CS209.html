Procedures and Policies
</center> </h1> <p>


<h2> <center>
Teaching Methods
</center> </h2> <p>


1. Lectures, videos, and Demonstrations: Important material from the text and outside sources will be covered 
in  online lectures.
 You should plan to take careful notes as not all material can be found in the texts or 
readings. 
2. Assignments: Skills Reviews, Project Builders, Design Project, Portfolio Project 
and other projects and readings will be periodically assigned to help support and 
supplement material found in the lessons. These assignments may require the application of various 
software applications. <br>

3. Exams: two exams will be given. The exams will be open book/note and will test assigned readings and material 
discussed in class. 
 The 
final exam will not be comprehensive in nature. However, the instructor 
reserves the right to retest on material that was not appropriately comprehended. 
<br>
<h2> <center>
Class Attendance
</center> </h2> <p>
  Come to class!  The college attendance policy will be followed in accordance with the college 
  catalog.  You’re expected to attend, you need to attend, we need you 
  to attend, and if you don’t attend, the following consequences may result: <br>
  
a) Non-textbook material discussed or presented in class may appear on exams. <br>
b) Assignments made in your absence are your responsibility to complete. <br>
c) Under WVUP policy, students may receive a failing grade when total absences exceed one week of class time. <br>
d) No make-up exams or assignments are offered.  A zero (0) will be earned on those graded experiences not completed on time.  (The instructor reserves the right to accommodate critical and/or exceptional cases. Legitimate schedule conflicts must be discussed with me well before an exam.  In order for considerations to be made for absences, last- minute problems require that you contact me via phone or e-mail at least one hour prior to class.  It is understood, however, that in a medical emergency, prior contact is not always possible or of relative importance and is taken into account in such cases.)   <br>

<h2> <center>
Homework
</center> </h2> <p>

  Homework is an essential element of any college course, and is particularly important in the 
  design field.  Creative exercises serve to reinforce and demonstrate understanding of design 
  techniques. Homework will be assigned, collected and graded.  

.c projects must compile with out errors, else do not turn them in.
.c projects also must be documented.

<h2> <center>
Student Responsibility
</center> </h2> <p>

 It is you, the student’s responsibility to attend class (see “Come to Class”!), 
 complete assignments, ask and answer questions as required, and seek assistance if and when 
 needed.  If you are having difficulties with ANY aspect of this course or program, please 

 call or send me a email message so that we may work to find a solution to our predicament.    <br>
 

Outcome Assessments:  70% of the students who complete the course will 
attain an evaluation of a C or better. This evaluation will reflect the student’s mastery of the course objectives.

<h2> <center>
Grading
</center> </h2> <p>
  Grades will be calculated based class participation, 
  homework assignments and a final project.  These will be weighted as follows: <br>
  

		Graded Projects	50% <br>
Exams			50% <br>
		Class Participation   - Used at the discretion of the instructor to determine a borderline grade. <br>

Honor Code
</center> </h1> <p>

As a member of the WVU Parkersburg community, students are asked to sign an honor code in 
which they commit to demonstrate honesty, integrity and civility through the mutual respect of: <br>
* Classmates and faculty by maintaining honesty in all academic work and refraining from cheating.  <br>
* Community and peers by maintaining integrity and honesty in the activities of daily life.  <br>
* Faculty, staff and members of the administration by maintaining civility and refraining from disruptive and abusive language and behavior.  <br>

<hr>
<h1> <center>
Email Accounts for Students
</center> </h1> <p>
All WVU Parkersburg students are required to use their college-assigned email account.   
<hr>
<h1> <center>

Miscellaneous
</center> </h1> <p>
 

 For effective learning and consideration for those around you, please turn off all 
pagers and cell phones prior to entering the classroom. <br>
 Also, in consideration for others, no disruptions, inappropriate behavior or language will be tolerated in the classroom. <br>
> Food and drink is not permitted in the laboratory. <br>
 Caution, cleanliness and courtesy are to be demonstrated if we are to continue allowing beverages and snacks in 
 lecture rooms.  Common sense should dictate how you take advantage of this liberty. <br>
 
 No smoking is allowed inside the Caperton Center. <br>

<hr>


The instructor (me) reserves the right to adjust, revise or 
amend the policies as required in order to best serve you, college, or the community. <br>

 Course schedule subject to change per discretion of Instructor.  <br>
