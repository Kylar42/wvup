During the first week, we were assigned to read this article:

After reading it I was fascinated with the idea of what the US would look like if it were a true democracy instead of a democratic republic - if every person had input and voting power on every single piece of legislation, at every level. 

#1) Would it be possible or workable for a country such as the US to function as a true democracy instead of a republic? 

#2) What are some of the biggest differences we would see, and how might it work at a local, state and/or federal level?

More food for thought: Would a fully democratic system bring more or less "politicking" and special interest groups, and would they be similar to current lobbyists, or very different? (This last bit is just something I've been thinking about.)
