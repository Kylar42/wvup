[20% of your final grade]

*NOTE: Remember there are two options for this assignment each reading: (1) Mini Lesson Plan or (2) Mini Analysis. This is YOUR choice.*

Due at the end of each reading schedule date per text. See calendar on eCampus for details.

These “Mini Lesson Plans” will be due at the end of the assigned reading period for each textbook in the course. They will outline a lesson you might do in the classroom for each book. 

You may use the template available in the “Course Documents” learning module on eCampus or ANY format of lesson plan you prefer. 

You will also include a discussion of your thoughts on the text with a brief analysis of either (a) What makes this text a classic of children’s literature or (b) How kids can relate to the story. 

Each Lesson Plan will be 1-2 pages double-spaced in 12pt Times New Roman font and the included analysis should be at least 1 page.
