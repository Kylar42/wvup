[20% of your final grade]

*NOTE: Remember there are two options for this assignment each reading: (1) Mini Lesson Plan or (2) Mini Analysis. This is YOUR choice.*

Due at the end of each reading schedule date per text. See calendar on eCampus for details.

For these "Mini Analyses," you must choose a theme from the book you're reading and compare it to another book, a current television series or a film. 

Comparing books to film/TV is a means of understanding how literature remains an important part of our popular culture, which always helps keep literature relevant.

For examples of the type of theme you can discuss, consider:
-friendship
-jealousy
-freedom
-guilt
-happiness
-family

Use any theme you notice in the book you're reading and feel free to discuss as you see fit.

You will also include a discussion of your thoughts on the text with a brief analysis of either (a) What makes this text a classic of childrenâ€™s literature or (b) How kids can relate to the story. This section can be as long as a page or as short as a sentence or two based on your thoughts about the text.

Each mini analysis will be 2-3 pages double-spaced in 12pt Times New Roman font.
