Ok, a few notes about this assignment.

It will look for the input files projects.txt and programmers.txt in the working directory.

It will write two output files to the working directory: doable-projects.txt and undoable-projects.txt.

The undoable project file lists the undoable projects, and ALL their skills. I wrote code to keep just the skills that were unavailable, but didn't think that's what you wanted. If it is, let me know and I'll add the code back in.

I added and modified some of your code in myfunctions.h and programmers.h. I removed all the other .c files, and cheated a bit, by putting all my project and programmer related code in their .h files, even when I probably should have declared some of the functions and then implemented them in a .c file. 

I tested this solution on a BSD based system (Darwin) and on RedHat enterprise Linux, and both worked.
