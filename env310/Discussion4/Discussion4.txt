This weeks topic of research is confined animal feeding operations (CAFO), otherwise known as "factory raised" or "feed lot" meat produced here in the United States. Choose one type of meat (chicken, beef, fish, pork etc.) and find 2 internet sources that seem legitimate on this topic.

Your goal is to research the life cycle of an animal raised under these conditions (birth to death).

In your post, you can discuss specific things that you learned from your research. But, at a minimum, your post should include:

* 2 negatives for the environment that result when we raise animals in this way.

* 2 positives for human beings that result when we raise animals in this way.

Please notate the websites that you used somewhere in your post.

This discussion will be available from Mon. June 25 to Sun. July 1 (9:00 PM). If your post is after this, it will be considered late.


I decided to explore the life cycle of a 'broiler' - a chicken raised for meat.

Day 1 - Chicks are born and sexed.
Day 2 - Chicks will be vaccinated and have their beaks trimmed (partially removed, usually with an electrically heated blade, so the wound will self-cauterize). They will then be transported to a Chicks are placed in a temperature controlled barn set to around 87 degrees, in flocks of up to 30,000. These barns are vast open areas with nothing but food and water dispensers. The floor is covered with dry bedding (usually rice hulls or wood chips) that will not be changed until the chickens are taken to slaughter. 
Day 21 - Chickens are now 'adult', and have full feathers. The temperature in the barn has been reduced to 70-73 degrees. By this time, the amount of bird waste can generate very noticeable smells of ammonia gas. The waste will remain until the birds are removed. This can have increasing effects on the chickens respiratory systems.
Day 42-50 - As soon as the chicken has reached it's 'target weight' it will be killed and packaged. 
Chickens go from birth to the table in 6 weeks. 

Negatives for the environment are: litter, sanitation and dangerous chemicals. There are multiple toxic chemicals being introduced into our environment and ground water. In addition to the huge amounts of ammonia from the litter, a common antibiotic agent roxarsone contains arsenic, which is excreted in the chickens waste. The sheer amount of waste is enormous - it is estimated that the amount of waste removed is roughly equal to the amount of feed that is brought in to each farm. Another environmental issue are the sanitary problems that come along with a large chicken farm - dead birds, insects, blood, contaminated water - it all goes into our landfills and into the ground, which in turn goes into our water and atmosphere.

Positives for humans are (as they always seem to be): Money and Space/Time(Convenience). In today's time, most people have neither the desire nor the time to raise their own meat. Population densities in most cities and towns have made the idea unrealistic. Personally, I don't have the time or space to raise the several dozen chickens, one cow, two deer and two pigs that I and my family eat each year (Not to mention the legal issues, and how much my neighbors would complain.) Also, at a small scale, the raising of animals is very economically poor in the cost-to-return ratio. The cost for me to go and buy a dozen chickens, build a coop, put in the time to feed and clean up after them, then to shuck and slaughter them would be far more than the cost to simply buy them at the store. Working at a huge scale (some farms raise up to 6 flocks of 100,000 chickens each year) makes this economically viable.
