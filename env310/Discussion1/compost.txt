Composting.

I took a slightly more narrow look at the question: "What types of material are recyclable." I focused on the idea that a significant portion of the garbage of a fast food restaurant must be food, and would be theoretically compostable (which is close enough to recyclable, for the sake of this discussion).

Based on a publication from the EPA: (http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/composting/basic.htm) Some of the top things NOT to compost are Dairy products (milk/cheese), Meat, Fats, grease and Oils. 

According to TLC (http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/10-ingredients-fast-food.htm) - 3 of 4 the most common ingredients in fast food are Chicken (#1), Mono and Diglycerides (generally Palm, soybean, sunflower oil or beef tallow)(#3), and  Soybean Oil (#4). Therefore, the most common things in available fast food are not recommended for composting. If restaurants were to separate all food into a single container, they would still have to go through and separate the "recommended" compostable (veggies, etc), from the "non-recommended" compostable (Meat, cheeses, fries) - which would probably cost more, while providing no tangible benefit to the restaurant. 

As with all changes - if the cost to maintain the restaurant and provide the food goes up, it will be reflected in the price. If I'm paying $20 or $30 per person, an additional $0.25 may well go unnoticed, but when a super value meal is $2.99, that extra quarter is much bigger, percentage wise.


Finally, we come to the idea that some fast foods may be so chemical laden that they just won't biodegrade the same way that other foods do. Some different people took a McDonald's Happy Meal home and took pictures of it, waiting for it to decompose. Up to a year, they appeared virtually unchanged.

Having said that, I believe that mandatory composting and recycling is worthwhile, but that it will require legislation to make happen. At my work cafeteria, they introduced the 3 bin recycling (compost, recycle, trash) last year, and although it took a few times to get used to, now I don't even think about it.
