Coal-fired power plants produce a large percentage of the electricity for our country. Please visit at least 2 websites (and notate them in your post) regarding these types of power plants.

Your goal is to come up with at least 2 positive outcomes (for human kind) that occur directly because of burning coal to generate electricity. 

You also need to come up with at least 2 negative outcomes (for humans) from burning coal to create electricity.

Also, find the answer to ONE of these questions and list it somewhere in your post:

*If we stay at the current rate of consumption, how many years before the coal supply is totally depleted?

*List the top 3 countries (in decreasing order) in terms of coal consumption.

*What are the most dangerous pollutants from coal and what are their side effects?

*How many people's employment is directly related to the use of coal?

*What is currently being done with the leftover material (ash) that remains after the coal is burned?

This discussion will be considered active until Sunday, June 3rd at 9:00 PM. If you post after this time, points will be deducted for lateness.
