Coal-fired power plants produce a large percentage of the electricity for our country. Please visit at least 2 websites (and notate them in your post) regarding these types of power plants.

Your goal is to come up with at least 2 positive outcomes (for human kind) that occur directly because of burning coal to generate electricity. 

You also need to come up with at least 2 negative outcomes (for humans) from burning coal to create electricity.

Also, find the answer to ONE of these questions and list it somewhere in your post:

*If we stay at the current rate of consumption, how many years before the coal supply is totally depleted?

*List the top 3 countries (in decreasing order) in terms of coal consumption.

*What are the most dangerous pollutants from coal and what are their side effects?

*How many people's employment is directly related to the use of coal?

*What is currently being done with the leftover material (ash) that remains after the coal is burned?


Positives:
The primary positive outcome for humankind is the short term economic benefit. Coal is still one of the cheapest methods of producing energy worldwide, and provides a tremendous secondary boon to the economy. A single coal plant can burn as much as 80,000 tons of coal per day, and the associated labor to mine, process and transport the coal provides many thousands of jobs. A second benefit is that electricity production via coal is relatively safe, when worst case scenarios are considered and contrasted with a more volatile energy source such as nuclear fission.

Negatives:
One of the most obvious drawback of coal is the pollution. Despite the advances in reducing toxic emissions, coal plants still release sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, mercury and Nitrous oxide into the environment.  A more pressing issue is the associated healthcare and environmental costs directly from mining, transporting and burning coal. A recent estimate states that in the US, costs yearly healthcare, deaths and ecological from coal mining and power top 345 billion dollars.

Question:
What are the most dangerous pollutants of coal, and what are their side effects?
The most dangerous pollutants released into the environment are Sulphur Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxide, Carbon Dioxide, and Mercury.  Sulphur Dioxide has been linked to breathing difficulties, respiratory illnesses and chronic heart and lung diseases, and along with Nitrogen Oxide, is a major cause of acid rain. Mercury has been shown to affect the immune and nervous system, and is particularly toxic to embryos, both human and animal, causing deformation and other difficulties. Carbon Dioxide levels have been rising in the atmosphere for decades, and are a primary contributor to global warming.
