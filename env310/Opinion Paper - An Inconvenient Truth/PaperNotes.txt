The first part of this assignment is to watch the documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth" (2006) featuring Al Gore, in its entirety. This movie is available in the library at WVUP, the public library, and Netflix (not on-demand, but DVD through the mail). Keep a notebook handy why you are watching the film so you can jot down a few notes/thoughts while you are observing.

Upon completion of the film, you will write a 3-4 page (double-spaced) opinion paper about the movie. Because it is an opinion paper, you will not need any references (besides the movie). However, if you choose to use information from other sources, they must be notated (use APA style with author name and date within paper and a "sources cited" at the end of the paper).

The goal of the paper is for you to process a FEW MAIN THEORIES presented in the film and come to your own conclusions about them. The following points can be used as a guideline when you are attempting to put all of your thoughts together.

* Describe the relationship between carbon dioxide and global temperatures.

* What specific circumstances are creating an abundance of carbon dioxide?

*This film is over 5 years old (which is a long time in the field of environmental science). Do you think any of the ideas are outdated? Has anything appeared to change since the production of the film (you may need sources for this)?

* Are there any theories/ideas presented in the film that you think are exagerrated or overemphasized for dramatic effect?

* Do you think the cigarette analogy is appropriate to our nations current (or past) outlook on the theory of global warming?

*What is your current outlook on the theory of global warming? 

*Do you think this is the biggest issue that our generation will face?

*In 20 to 50 years, do you think we as a people (Americans) will have made changes to live in better synchrony with the planet? Or do you think we will mostly maintain our old habits long into the future (continue fossil fuel use until total depletion)?

This assignment is due by Friday, August 3rd at 9:00 PM. Please submit your paper ANYTIME BEFORE THE DUE DATE as an attachment (as a word document) here in the assignment tab.
