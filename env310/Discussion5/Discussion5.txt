We have had a lot of heavy topics for our discussions thus far. So, I thought I would lighten the mood on this one. 

I would like you to research an environmental success story. Your topic could include one of the following:

* a threatened/endangered species that is making a comeback

*habitat that is coming back because people are allowing it to regenerate 

* a component of the environment that is returning to a balanced state

Once you have decided on your topic, please visit atleast 2 websites to do your research (and notate them in your post). Then, in your OWN WORDS, write a paragraph about the success story by telling us the following:

*why animal/thing/place was in decline/threatened originally

*what people have done to protect it

*how animal/thing/place is making a comeback now

This discussion will be available from Mon. July 9th to Sun. July 16th (9:00 PM). If you post after this time, it will be considered late and points will be deducted.



The Bald Eagle

The Bald Eagle was a critically endangered species in the US as recently as a few decades ago, but now thrives in the US. It is estimated that the population of this majestic bird was as high as 300,000-500,000 as recently as the 18th century, but by the early 1960's, the population had dropped to less than 500 breeding pairs. The cause of this massive drop stemmed from many sources, including loss of terrain, and poaching. Scientists agree that the effect of insecticides (most notably DDT) on it's eggs was also one of the biggest causes. DDT, a popular insecticide in the 1940's and 50's was being concentrated in the bald eagle population (thanks to biomagnification). DDT caused the birds' calcium metabolism to change, and thus the eggshells became thinner and eventually were unable to support the weight of the chicks inside. 

The Bald Eagle was known to have declining populations early in the 20th century, and was officially declared an Endangered Species in 1967. It was not until some years after DDT was banned in 1972 that the populations stopped declining. There were several methods by which the Bald Eagle population was brought back - Special lands were designated for the eagles, eaglets were transported from other areas and re-introduced in sparse locations, and captive breeding programs have all contributed to it's comeback. Today, the estimated number of breeding pairs throughout the lower 48 states is nearly 10,000 - still a tiny fraction of previous numbers, but enough that the eagle was removed from the Endangered Species list in 2007.
